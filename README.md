The task:
Duration: 2-4h
The World Bank has an API and your task is to find the next China. 
Retrieve and visualise GDP growth rates of nations like India, Vietnam, Indonesia for as long as you can access\
the data, and tell us what the projected growth rate will be, taking into account population growth\
and other economic factors. 

Compare it to a country like Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia, where they were one slow, but grew, and see if\
you can predict stagnation.

The expectations are to use the API effectively, transform data, and utilise a front-end to show\
time series data effectively. 


Steps:
[] 1. Explore data from World Bank API.
    - WBGAPI: https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/introducing-wbgapi-new-python-package-accessing-world-bank-data
    - https://towardsdatascience.com/access-a-world-of-data-with-wbgapi-61849354f769


[] 2. Init simple backend - frontend application to visualize data.
